    "# Blog - Week 1 (06/22/20)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuesday \n",
    "- Radvel successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wednesday \n",
    "- Met with Lee to discuss Radvel documents and download Mayor & Queloz paper.\n",
    "- Next steps: Read Mayor & Queloz and complete Radvel tutorial then check in with Lee.\n",
    "- Short-term objective: Understand the part of the radvel code that will enable the generation of the Keplerian Zoo chart.\n",
    "- Notes:\n",
    "    - Radvel fits RV data - often from multiple instruments - to Keplerian orbits.\n",
    "    - Lee's thesis is largely focused on occurrence rates for various planet types.\n",
    "- Big picture: Collecting planetary census data will ultimately provide evidence for various hypotheses in planetary formation theories to help understand which models are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Friday/Saturday\n",
    "- Ran radvel tutorial for HD 164922\n",
    "    - Cell 2: Function for binning data. Data is read into a pandas dataframe with time, mean rv, error in rv, and telescope (data from three telescopes).\n",
    "        - What is jd_date and how is it different than time? Is this just a logistical requirement to convert the time into an integer for later calculations? What is mnvel?\n",
    "    - Cell 3: Initializes parameters. In this case there are two sets of parameters, one for each of two different planets.\n",
    "        - What are the parameters \"tc, secosw, sesinw, logk, dvdt and curv?\" If dvdt is change in radial velocity over time, why is it set to zero? Or is it angular velocity?\n",
    "    - Cell 4: Initializes the model. \n",
    "        - What exactly is 'jitter' and how is it quantified? \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Read Mayor & Queloz 1995\n",
    "    - See Week 2 for questions and notes"
