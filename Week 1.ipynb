    "- Radvel successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wednesday \n",
    "- Met with Lee to discuss Radvel documents and download Mayor & Queloz paper.\n",
    "- Next steps: Read Mayor & Queloz and complete Radvel tutorial then check in with Lee.\n",
    "- Short-term objective: Understand the part of the radvel code that will enable the generation of the Keplerian Zoo chart.\n",
    "- Notes:\n",
    "    - Radvel fits RV data - often from multiple instruments - to Keplerian orbits.\n",
    "    - Lee's thesis is largely focused on occurrence rates for various planet types.\n",
    "- Big picture: Collecting planetary census data will ultimately provide evidence for various hypotheses in planetary formation theories to help understand which models are accurate."
